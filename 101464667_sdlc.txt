Importance of DevOps in the software development cycle

There are two different teams in software development: the development team, who plan, design, and build the software; and the operations team, who tests and implements the developed software. 
Because the separation of these two teams lead to delays due to reasons such as communication or differences in their environment, The DevOps process was created.

DevOps addresses these issues by breaking the separation between the two teams to enhance communication and efficiency. 
It does this by establishing practices and utilizing tools to create a continuous loop where development activities like planning and building code are directly connected to operations activities such as testing and releasing code.

The DevOps cycle consists of:
Plan - where requirements are identified and information is collected
Code - where the development takes place
Build - code is compiled and integrated together
Test - where the build is deployed and tested
Release - software is released to production
Deploy - infrastructure is created and code is deployed
Operate - where customers can use software
Monitor - observation of the software performance

This "loop" promotes a cycle of continuous and constant collaboration between the two teams which is essential in the software development cycle.
